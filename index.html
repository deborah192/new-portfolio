        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Deborah, a passionate and versatile software developer with a strong foundation in <span class="button-text">JAVA</span> , <span class="button-text">PYTHON</span>, <span class="button-text">HTML</span>, <span class="button-text">CSS</span>, and <span class="button-text">JAVASCRIPT</span>. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to delivering high-quality code, I thrive on creating efficient and scalable solutions that meet user needs and exceed expectations.

            My journey in software development began a few years ago, and since then, I’ve honed my skills through various projects and collaborations. Whether it’s building dynamic <span class="button-text">WEB APPLICATIONS</span>, developing robust backend systems, or ensuring seamless user experiences, I bring a holistic approach to every project I undertake.
            
            <br>One of my key strengths is <span class="button-text">LOCALIZATION</span>, where I specialize in adapting software to meet the linguistic, cultural, and technical requirements of different regions. This expertise allows me to create applications that are not only functional but also resonate with diverse user bases.
            
            I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies. This mindset drives me to constantly improve my skills and explore new tools and frameworks that can enhance my development process.
            
            <br>When I’m not coding, you can find me building a DIY project, which helps me stay creative and balanced. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects.
            
            Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
